# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was motivated by a desire to learn coding basics to begin this full stack bootcamp! I built this project to fulfil the course's prework requirements, but also to get a base knowledge of the following topics prior to classes beginning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The project also allowed me to practice my coding skills in real time, seeing my work come to life on a browser! I learned the basics of the topics listed above, and the GitHub process. I added branches and merged them to my site to practice the GitHub process for future projects.
