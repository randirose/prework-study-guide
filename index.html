        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements are used to create the structure of a webpage, provide content and basic framework for webpages</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage not visible to the user</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>A semantic element describes its content and the role it plays on the webpage; a non-semantic element can be used to solve structural problems</li>
          <li>The h1 to h6 tags represent headers in different sizes</li>
          <li>The ul tag represents an unordered or unnumbered list</li>
          <li>The li tag represents each list item</li>
          <li>The img tag contains info on how to display an image and the src attribute defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The br tag creates a line of empty space</li>
          <li>The a href tag is used to create hyperlinks</li>
          <li>The section tag can be used to break up content on a page</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To style an element directly in the HTML file, we use inline CSS, which can be useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than using an internal or external style sheet</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets are embedded directly in the HTML file using a style element within the head element; these rules <i>only</i> apply to that page</li>
          <li>The most common and preferred way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>An external style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
          <li>Use a link element placed in the HTML's head element to link to an external CSS</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Assign colors in CSS with semantic references such as gray or blue, or by its hexadecimal code, or hex #</li>
          <li>Use class selectors to designate which elements in your HTML will contain those property assignments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A repository or "repo" is a folder for your project that contains all of the files and revision history</li>
          <li>Creating a new branch allows you to make changes that won't affect the live site</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to that branch</li>
          <li>Create a Pull Request to ask for changes on a branch to merge into another branch</li>
          <li>Use git commit -m to add a description to the changes you're making to your branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript adds logic and functionality to a webpage or application</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
          <li>"IF" statements allow us to interrupt the control flow, which allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions</li>
          <li>Use an array to hold a group of related data in a single variable</li>
          <li>Indexes assign a number to each item in an array, starting with 0</li>
